01. Try to declare the variable with/without public static final keywords. Is there any difference between these two
approches? why?
 No difference,
 In this interface methode they already assign as (public, static) final (default)

02. Declare the abstract method with/without abstract keyword. Is there any difference between these two
approches? why?
 No differernce,
 In this abstract methode they already assign as (default) abstract method. only in interface method.
